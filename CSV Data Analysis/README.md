# Data Analysis using Python

## 📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates basic data analysis using Python.  
The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and analyzed using the Pandas library.  
Various visualizations are created using Matplotlib to understand patterns and trends in the data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- VS Code  
- GitHub  

## 📂 Dataset
**sales.csv**  
The dataset contains sales-related information such as product, quantity, and revenue.

## 📊 Analysis Performed
- Loaded CSV file using Pandas  
- Calculated average values of numerical columns
